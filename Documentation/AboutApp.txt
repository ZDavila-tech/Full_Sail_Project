		~About Naval Travel Calculator~
The Navy Travel Calculator is used to determine the distance, 
how long it will take, and the number of times the aircraft needs 
to be refueled between two locations that the Navy aircraft will need to travel. 
I developed this application in Android Studio, so this will be compatible with 
Android mobile devices. The emulator I used in this project was the Android 
Pixel_3a_API_30_x86. The basis of this project came from an idea I had to make 
travel easier for the Navy pilots who had travel between Navy bases to transport 
supplies. First, I began to research how many aircraft models the Navy has currently. 
I found a list from Military.com of the Naval aircraft active in use. Along with 
the name of the aircraft, the list also contained information on the maximum speed 
and range of the aircraft. The link to the list of Active US Navy Aircraft is 
down below:
