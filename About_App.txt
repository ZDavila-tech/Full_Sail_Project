		~About Naval Travel Calculator~
The Navy Travel Calculator is used to determine the distance, 
how long it will take, and the number of times the aircraft needs 
to be refueled between two locations that the Navy aircraft will need to travel.
The basis of this project came from an idea I had to make travel easier for the Navy
pilots who had travel between Navy bases to transport supplies. First, I began to 
research how many aircraft models the Navy has currently. I found a list 
from Military.com of the Naval aircraft active in use. Along with the name 
of the aircraft, the list also contained information on the maximum speed and range 
of the aircraft. The link to the list of Active US Navy Aircraft is down below:
